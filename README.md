You can add anything to this To-do-list (No Login Required). If you want to create your own to-do page, simply go to the URL and add "/yourListName" then you can create a new and your own list (but anyone can add or delete the tasks). If you want it to be private you can add a long and unguessable suffix after the URL like "/longUrl" 😁.
